### **Essential AWS Setup with GitHub for Day 1**:

1. **GitHub Repository Creation**:
    - Create two repositories on **GitHub**: `EstiMateGPT-API` (for backend) and `EstiMateGPT-UI` (for frontend).

2. **AWS Amplify Initial Setup**:
    - Navigate to **AWS Amplify**.
    - Begin the process to connect the `EstiMateGPT-UI` repository. Stop after linking, without initiating deployment.

3. **AWS Lambda Placeholder**:
    - In **AWS Lambda**, initiate the creation of a new function for the API. Name it and reserve it for later.

4. **IAM Role Creation**:
    - In **IAM**, create two roles: one for the API and another for the UI. Assign only the essential permissions needed for Day 1.

5. **API Gateway Initialization**:
    - In **API Gateway**, begin setting up a new API. Name it and reserve it for detailed configuration later.

6. **CI/CD Readiness**:
    - Familiarize yourself with **AWS CodePipeline** and consider creating a basic pipeline structure for both API and UI, integrating GitHub as the source.

By focusing on just these essential preparatory tasks, you'll be well-positioned to delve into the actual development and integration on Days 2 and 3. This approach ensures a smooth start without overwhelming the initial setup day.
