### **Error Handling & Response Status Codes**:

1. **200 OK**: Successful GET request or successful POST/PUT/PATCH request where an entity is successfully retrieved, created, or modified.

2. **201 Created**: Successful POST request where a new entity was successfully created.

3. **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there's no representation to return (i.e. the response is empty).

4. **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid. Common during validation errors.

5. **401 Unauthorized**: The user isn't logged in, i.e. there's no valid token for user authentication in the request header.

6. **403 Forbidden**: The authenticated user doesn't have access to the requested resource.

7. **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found. Common for invalid URLs or non-existent IDs.

8. **409 Conflict**: The request could not be completed due to a conflict. Common for duplicate entries.

9. **500 Internal Server Error**: Generic error message when an unknown error occurs server-side.

It's good practice to always return meaningful error messages in the response body for any error, providing clarity to the client on what went wrong and possibly how to fix it.

In the development process, having comprehensive logging and monitoring will also be invaluable in catching, diagnosing, and addressing issues that may arise.
